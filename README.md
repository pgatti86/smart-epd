# Smart edp

Smart-epd is a study project for the esp32 IDF framework.

The final scope is to build an alarm clock with some added features like temperature and humidity monitoring, local weather infos, and OTA updates.

## BOM

- Any esp32 breakout board (with at least 4MB flash size)
- Waveshare 2.9inch E-paper Module (296x128 px)
- DHT22 temperature and humidity module

## Getting Started

This repo depends on epd [library](https://github.com/pgatti86/epd) as git submodule.

To clone this project use **git clone --recursive <project url>** 

Project Makefile has the following configuration to include the submodule library in the build process:

**EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS += $(PROJECT_PATH)/epd/components/**

The project support both IDFv3 and IDFv4 build systems.

IDFv3 build system [reference](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3/api-guides/build-system.html)

IDFv4 (beta1) build system [reference](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.1-beta1/api-guides/build-system.html)

###### *below command may vary based on selected build system (v3 / v4)

## Configurations

Before flashing the app you will need to configure the device with **make menuconfig** command:

### App settings

Enter SMART-EPD config menu to configure the application (some defaults values applies)

- WEATHER_API_KEY : forecast API key. See Open weather API key section below
- SNTP_SERVER: defaults to "pool.ntp.org"
- DHT_GPIO: reads temperature and humidity from DHT22 on specified GPIO. Defauts to GPIO 4
- BUTTON_GPIO: wipes the device memory when holded longer then 3s. Defaults to 0 (builtin button)
- MAX_REWRITE_COUNT: number of screen rewrite before eink full clean apply. Defualts to once in an hour

Save and exit.

### Partition Tables

The app uses a custom partition table defined in partitions.csv file:

In "Partition table" men첫 select "Partition Table" sub-men첫.
Check the "custom partition table" option.

You also need to change the embedded flash size:
In "Serial flasher" men첫 enter "Flash size" sub-men첫 and select 4MB.

Save and exit.
Back in CLI run "make" command.
You can check partition table with "make partition_table" command.

### Open weather API key

You need an open api key for weather updates.
Register your account at https://openweathermap.org and set your api key in menuconfig.


## Spiffs partition generation

Look for spiffs folder in project, it contains:

- device subfolder: contains the device configurations:
```json
{
"deviceId":"1d3053b1-4c31-40da-9533-2eacca528add"
}
```

#### NB: an empty line at the end of the config file is mandatory otherwise the json parsing library (cJSON) will fail deserialization.

- security subfolder: currently empty, it will contain the mqtt broker certificates

- spiffsgen.py: script used to generate *.img partitions

- esptool.py: script to write partitions generated with the above script into target device flash memory

To generate and flash the device configuration image use the following commands

```console
spiffsgen.py 204800 ~/device-folder-path ~/destination-path/device.bin

esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART --baud 921600 write_flash 0x311000 ~/img-path/device.bin
```

To generate and flash the device secuity image use the following commands

```console
spiffsgen.py 204800 ~/security-folder-path/security ~/destination-path/security.bin

esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART --baud 921600 write_flash 0x343000 ~/img-path/security.bin
```

## Enrollment

A new device starts in Access Point [AP] mode, it displays WiFi credentials and PoP (proof of possession) token on the screen.
After connecting to the device network you need to send the following paylod at the device (192.168.1.1) with a POST request:

```json
{
"ssid":"SSID",
"password": "PASSWORD",
"zip": "25063",
"code" : 75091,
}
```

The provided zip code is used for weather forecasting.

cURL example

```console
curl -X POST \
  http://192.168.1.1/setCredentials \
  -d '{
"ssid":"SSID",
"password": "PASSWORD",
"code" : 75091
}'
```

## Reset

You can reset the device pressing and holding the right module button for at least 3 seconds.
After reset the device will return in enrollment mode.

## How connect eink display

| Signal | GPIO |
| --- | --- |
| DIN / MOSI  | GPIO_NUM_23  |
| CLK | GPIO_NUM_18  |
| CS | GPIO_NUM_5   |
| DC | GPIO_NUM_26  |
| RST | GPIO_NUM_27  |
| BUSY | GPIO_NUM_32  |

## Custom fonts

To create custom fonts you need to generate a PNG file with all required characters (95).
See this [guide](https://kapusta.cc/2019/02/10/font2bytes/) for reference

Useful reading: [Making graphics and fonts for embedded systems](https://lb9mg.no/2018/02/10/making-graphics-and-fonts-for-embedded-systems/)

Look at fonts folder for examples.
